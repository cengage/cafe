# CAFe

Common Analytics Framework for Eventing (CAFe) is an open-source project released by Cengage Learning.
It provides a pattern for implementing client-side eventing, as well as the back-end analytics infrastructure for reliably capturing and processing the event data.
CAFe is similar in function to Google Tag Manager (GTM)

Cengage built this library when it realised that analytics pipelines built upon GTM were suffering from data loss due to common ad-blocker software.
